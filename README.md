# pocketCube

This is a C implementation of a BFS algorithm that finds the [God's number for the pocket cube](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/gods-number/)
The algorithm can transform each unique state of the cube into an index to a 2D array. That allows us to only hold 1B for each cube configuration!
